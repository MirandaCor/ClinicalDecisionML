# ClinicalDecisionML
Machine learning in clinical data analysis enables the extraction of meaningful patterns from complex, high-dimensional healthcare datasets to support diagnosis, risk stratification, prognosis, and treatment decision-making. By leveraging structured data (e.g., laboratory values, vital signs, demographics) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes or medical images), machine learning models can assist clinicians in identifying early warning signals, predicting adverse outcomes, and personalizing care.

Beyond predictive performance, effective clinical machine learning emphasizes data quality, interpretability, calibration of probabilities, and rigorous validation to ensure clinical reliability and safety. When integrated thoughtfully into clinical workflows, these methods function as decision-support tools that augment—rather than replace—medical expertise, ultimately improving efficiency, consistency, and patient outcomes.
